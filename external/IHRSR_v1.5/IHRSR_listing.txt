List of programs in IHRSR_v1.5

Note that all Spider scripts can be referenced using both the spd or
spi extensions and Perl scripts can be called with or without the pl
extension. Symbolic links are set as necessary.

----- Spider scripts -----

o apply_function.spd: Applies a function to an image; normally used to
apply 1/CTF^2 to the final map

o bob_helix.spd: This is the main helical reconstruction application and
is based on Ed Egelman's IHRSR program. Make a copy of this file in
the directory where you'll be working, give it a new name so that you
don't accidentally access the original file in the SPPROC_DIR
directory, and edit parameters at top of file.

o center_tubes.spd: Center boxed tube segments

o ctf_corr_noprompt.spd: Correct an image for CTF (version without
user prompts)

o ctf_corr.spd: Correct and image for CTF

o filter.spd: Apply low/high pass filters to an image

o get_tube_diameters.spd: Determine diameters of tube segment in an
image stack

o ipdlp.spd: invert, low pass, and decimate (bin) an image

o pwstack.spd: Calculate power spectra of images in a stack

o sort_by_diameter.spd: Sort images in a stack based on tube
diameter. Used in conjunction with get_tube_diameters.spd

o split_stack.spd: Split image stack into two stacks

o mappw2.spd: Generate simulated power spectrum from map or projection
of map

----- Perl scripts -----

o avg_pw2.pl: Calculate an averaged power spectrum from multiple power
spectra

o helix_automation.pl: For one or more images: convert image file to
Spider format with correct byte-ordering, rename file to avoid
multiple periods (Spider treats everything after first period as the
extension), and generate 2D power spectrum.

o helix_cutstk.pl: Generate a stack file of helix segments from a set
of boxed helices

o merge_stack.pl: Merge two or more image stacks into a single stack

o multirun.pl: Launch multiple reconstructions

----- Other programs -----

o cplot: Contour plotting program

o generator: GUI for generating IHRSR script. Can be used instead of
manually editing bob_helix.spd, but does not take advantage of newest
capabilities.

o himpose: Impose helical symmetry on a structure. Recently modifed to
generate long maps or projections of long maps by providing additional
command line arguments. (called by bob_helix.spd)

o himpose_long: Impose helical symmetry on a long structure. This
program is provided solely for back-compatibility and functionality is
now contained in himpose.

o hplot: Histogram plotting program

o hsearch_lorentz: Search for helical symmetry parameters (called by
bob_helix.spd)

o splot: Plot helical symmetry parameters as function of iteration

o xhelicals: Interactive version of hsearch
