IHRSR++ v1.3 February 5, 2010

IHRSR++ is a user-friendly extension to the Ed Egelman's Iterative
Helical Real Space Reconstruction (IHRSR) software. It includes all of
the original IHRSR functionality plus the capabilities to determine
out-of-plane tilt, apply dihedral symmetry, and automatically
construct a starting model from the image data.

IHRSR++ also contains a number of Perl and Spider scripts for
performing common preprocessing and data manipulation tasks such as
power spectra calculations, application of CTF corrections, image
stack generation, image centering, and tube diameter determination.

IHRSR++ is free software, licensed under the BSD license. Although we
have successfully used it for a number of reconstructions, it should
be considered a work in progress. Owing to time constraints, neither
the Egelman nor Baker labs are able to provide support. The software
is provided purely as a convenience to those attempting helical
reconstructions.
