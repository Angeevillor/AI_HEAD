---------- Modifications new to IHRSR_v1.5 ----------

(1) updated syntax for making the scripts compatible with Spider v21

---------- Modifications new to IHRSR_v1.4 ----------

(1) bob_helix.spd modified to more easily handle the transition from
    reconstruction without dihedral symmetry to one with dihedral
    symmetry. If the corresponding "svolume" file does not exist, a
    symbolic link is set that points to the volume file. For example

    svolume_005.dat --> volume_005.dat

(2) New program mappw2.spd takes either a 3D map or a 2D projection of
    the map and generates a simulated power spectrum. For best results
    a long version of the map should be generated using himpose and
    the largest possible padding should be used. Experience shows that
    using maps and padding dimensions of 8192 works best.

(3) All spider scripts that need to determine the number of images in
    a stack now do so much more efficiently.

(4) pwstack.spd modified to give user choice of generating stack of
    power spectra, averaged power spectrum, or both from input image
    stack.

(5) himpose modified to handle functionality contained in himpose_long
    and to optionally generate a 2D projection of the map instead of
    the 3D map.

(6) hsearch_lorentz and himpose both write usage information to stdout
    if executed with either no or insufficient command line arguments.

(7) All spider scripts that use the FR command modified to use RR
    where appropirate. The former is meant only for string data while
    the latter is meant for register variables.

(8) Add 3rd argument to dimensions in PD command where necessary. As
    of spider 18.10, the 3rd argument is required (set to 1) even if
    working with 2d images

---------- Modifications new to IHRSR_v1.3 ----------

(1) Added new spider script center_tubes.sp[di]. Takes an image stack
    and generates a new stack with the tube sgements properly centered
    in the box.

(2) helix_automation now has greater flexibility in handling different
    file types (mrc, dat, and spi extensions). Also has option to
    generate windowed power spectra to minimize the amount of disk
    space used.

(3) Documentation added to helix_cutstk

(4) bob_helix.spd modified to more diligently remove temporary files
    that may cause problems upon restarting calculations.

---------- Modifications new to IHRSR_v1.2 ----------

(1) bob_helix now has capabilities for determining out-of-plane tilt

(2) Created version of CTF correction script that does not require a
    prompt (ctf_corr_noprompt.spi). Done so that program can be run in
    batch mode.

(3) Modified bob_helix.spd to automatically generate starting map if
    one has not been provided.

(4) Get rid of merge_stack.pl and replace with v1.0 merge_stack.pl to
    allow merging of multiple files.

(5) Modified bob_helix to use "PJ 3Q" instead of "PJ 3" to generate
    projections of the model. The former is supposed to be much faster
    than the latter.

(6) Implemented fix in ipdlp.spd so that the resolution parameter can
    contain a decimal place. For example, in the old version "25"
    would work as a cutoff resolution but "25.0" would fail. Probably
    due to some weirdness in how spider parses expressions.

(7) Added new script pwstack.spd that generates a stack of power
    spectra from an image stack.

(8) ctf correction scripts now correctly handle non-square images and
    dynamically set size of padded image before applying ctf.

(9) helix_automation now allows user to omit applying threshold to
    power spectra.

(10) Improved memory management in himpose and hsearch_lorentz so that
     arrays are dynamically set to the right size. No longer necessary
     to recompile for different sized images or symmetry
     parameters. Deleted himpose_big since it is now subsumed by
     himpose.

---------- Modifications new to IHRSR_v1.1 ----------

(1) New script ctf2inv calculates the average 1/(CTF^2) from list of
    defocus values and stack sizes. Automatically accounts for number
    of images in each stack and sets values at low spatial frequencies
    to reasonable value.

(2) New script apply_function applies a function to transform of a
    map. Typically used in conjuction with ctf2inv.

(3) merge_stack.pl has been replaced with the spider script
    merge_stack. This has been done so as to be consistent with the
    split_stack script

(4) merge_stack and split_stack now delete existing output files
    before writing new files. Avoids problems when new stacks have
    fewer images than old stacks.

(5) ctf_corr_othersign has been merged into ctf_corr. User will now be
    prompted for sign.

(6) Additional options added to filter
