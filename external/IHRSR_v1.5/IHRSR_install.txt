***** Installation

Simply uncompress and un-tar the archive, and copy the IHRSR directory
to the desired location.

      tar -xzvf IHRSR_vx.y.tar.gz
      cp -r IHRSR_vx.x IHRSR_path

Then set your path so that scripts and executables can be found. For
example, add the following to your .csrhc file

      set path = (/IHRSR_path/IHRSR_vx.y $path)
      setenv SPPROC_DIR /IHRSR_path/IHRSR_vx.y

For users running on an x86_64 architecture, the software should be
ready to use. If you need to rebuild the himpose and hsearch_lorentz
applications, go into the IHRSR_vx.y/src directory, execute 'make
all', and copy the executables into place.



***** Software requirements

Spider: The software should be able to run under any modern version of
Spider, but we strongly recommend that you upgrade to at least version
17.05. This will enable you to handle larger image sizes and take
advantage of faster algorithms. It will also ensure that the
relationship between the search range and max ring parameters
described in the main application (bob_helix.spd) is valid.

Perl: While not needed to run the main helical reconstruction program,
many of the preprocessing scripts are written in Perl. We haven't
tested this extensively, but any version of Perl 5 should work.

Fortran compiler: The software distribution is released with versions
of the external programs himpose and hsearch_lorentz precompiled for
x86_64 hardware. If you need to build these for another architecture
or wish to modify the applications, you'll need access to a Fortran
compiler. We have successfully used gfortran and PGI compilers, but
any Fortran 90 compliant compiler should do.

EMAN: Not required for the main helical reconstruction program, but is
helpful if you need to convert MRC files to Spider format (proc2d),
box helices from micrographs (helixboxer), or view results (v2).

libpgc.so: In the event that you need to call the program himpose_long
(not used by the standard helical reconstruction program), you'll need
to make sure that you have a copy of the libpgc.so library in
/usr/lib. This library is included in the software distribution.
